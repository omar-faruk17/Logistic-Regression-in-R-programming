This repository contains my work on the Logistic Regression in R for Public Health course by Imperial College London (Prof. Alex Bottle) on Coursera. The course focuses on applying logistic regression to public health data, specifically predicting diabetes.

The repository includes the following:

# R Script (logistic regression for public health.R): This script contains the code to build, fit, and evaluate a logistic regression model using a Diabetes dataset.

# Dataset (diabetes.RData): The dataset used for training the model, which includes patient information such as age, BMI, and glucose levels.

# Model Fit Understanding (model fir in logistic regression.txt): A file that provides a detailed interpretation of the model fit, including the significance of each variable, odds ratios, and overall model performance.
